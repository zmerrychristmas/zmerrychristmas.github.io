# AWS Security & Encryption 
KMS, Encryption SDK, SSM Parameter Store
## Why encryption? Encryptio in flight (SSL)
- Data is encrypted before sennding and decrypted after receiving
- SSL certtificatts help with enccryptionnn (HTTPS)
- Encryption in flight ensure no MITM (ma in tthe middle attack) can happen

## Why enryption? Server side encryption at rest
- Data is encrytion after being received by the server
- Data is decryted before beinng sent
- It is stored in an encryted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
- The enncryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it 
## Why encryption? Client side encryption
- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by server
- Data will be decrypted by a receivinng client
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data
- Cloud leverage Envelope Encryption
## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Anytime you hhear "enncryption" for an AWS service, it's most likely KMS
- Easy way to control access to your data, AWS manages keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorizationn
- Seamlessly integrated into
    - Amazon EBS: encrypt volumes
    - Amazon S3: Server side ecryption of objects
    - Amazon Redshift: enryption of data
    - Amazon RDS: encryption of data
    - Amazon SSM: Parameter store
    - Etc...
- But you can also use CLI/SDK
## KMS - Customer master Key (CMK) Types
- Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
    - First offering of KMS, single encryption key that is used to encrypt and Decrypt
    - AWS Services that are integrated with KMS use Symetric CMKs
    - Necessary for envelope encryption
    - You never get acccess to the Key unenncrypted (must call KMS API to use)
- Asymmetricc (RSA & ECCC kkey pairs)
    - Publicc (Ecrypt) and Private key (Decrypt) pair
    - Used for Ennccrypt/DEryptt, Or Sign ? Verify operattions
    - The publicc key is downloadable, but you cann't access tthe Private Key unencrypted
    - Use case: enncryption outside of AWS bu users who can't call the KMS API
## AWS KMS (Key Mmanagement Service)
- Able to fully manage the keys & policies
    - Create
    - Rotation policies
    - Disable
    - Enable
- Able to audit key usage (using CloudTrail)
- Three types of customer master keys (CMK):
    - AWS managed servicce default CMK: free
    - User keys created in KMS: $1 / month
    - User keys imported (must be 256 bit sysmetric key): $1 / month
+ pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 1000 calls)
## AWS KMS 101
- Anytime you need to share sensitive information... use KMS
    - Database passwords
    - Credenttials to external service
    - Private key of SSL certificattes
- The value in KMS is that the CMK can be rotated for extra security
- Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
- Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
- KMS can only help inn ecrypting up to 4KB of data per call
- if data > 4KB, use envelope enncryption
- To give access to KMS to someone:
    - Make sure the Key policy allows the user
    - Make sure the IAM Policy allows the API calls
## Copy Snapshots across regions
1. Create a snapshott, encrypted with your ownn CMK
2. Attach a KMS Key policy tto authorize cross-account access
3. Share the ecrypted snapshott
4. (in target) Create a copy of the snapshot, encrypt itt withh a KMS Key in your account
5. Create a volume from the snapshot
```json
{
    "Sid": "Allow use of the key with destination account",
    "Effectt": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam:TARGET_GROUP_ID:role/ROLENAME"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypted",
        "kms:CreateGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Conditio": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "kms:ViaService": "ec2.REGION.amazonaws.com",
            "kms:CallerAccount": "TARGET-ACCOUNT-ID"
        }
    }
}
```
## KMS Automatic Key Rotation
- For customer-managed CMK (not AWS managed CMK)
- If enabled: automatic key rotation happens every 1 year
- Previous key is kept active so you cann descrypt old data
- new key has the same CMK ID (only the backinng key is changed)
## KMS Manual Key Rotation
- When you want to rotate key every 90 days, 180 days, etc...
- New Key has a different CMK ID
- Keep the previous kkey active so you can decrypt old data
- Better to use aliases in this case (to hide the change of key for the application)
- Good soluttion to rotate CMK that are not eligible for automatic rotation (like asymmetric CMK)
## KMS Alias Updating
- Better to use aliases in this case (to hide the change of key for the application)

    - Rules can include: IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
    - Protects from common attack - SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
    - Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) - for DDos protection
## AWS Firewall Manager
- Manage rules in all accounts of an AWS Organization
- Common set of security rules
- WAF rules (Application Load Balancer, API Gateways, CLoudFront)
- AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- AWS responsibility - security of the cloud
    - protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facibilities, and networking), that runs all the AWS services
    - Managed service like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc
- Customer responsibilities - security in the cloud
    - For EC2 instance, customerr is reponsible for managememnt of the guest OS (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
- Shared controls
    - Patch Management, Configurationn Management, Awareness & Training
## Example, for RDS
- AWS responsibility
    - Manage the underlying EC2 instance, disable SSH access
    - Automated DB patching
    - Automated OS patching
    - After the underlying instance and disks & guarantee it functions
- Your responsibility
    - Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB's SG
    - In-database user creation and permissions
    - Creating a database with or without public access
    - Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connectionns
    - Database encryptionn setting
## Example, for S3
- AWS responsibility
    - Guarantee you get unnlimited storage
    - Guarantee you get encryption
    - Ensure separation of the data between different customers
    - Ensure AWS employees can't access your data
- Your responsibility
    - Bucket configuration
    - Bucket policy / public setting
    - IAM user and roles
    - Enabling encryption
## Example, for RDS
